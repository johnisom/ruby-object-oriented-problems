# Exercise 1

=begin

We create on object using the ::new method on a class. Of course, you must have
a class to be able to create an object in the first place, so I will define one
here:

class CoolClassNamedWithCamelCase
end

And then I can just call CoolClassNamedWithCamelCase.new and it will create a 
new object for me (in this case a freshly initialized Object object because
all new class definitions inherit Object unless otherwise stated).
